In the dynamic landscape of AWS resource management, catering to the diverse needs of QA, Dev, and production environments can be quite a juggling act. Rather than embarking on a daunting quest to rewrite or edit all Terraform code in one monolithic sweep, a smarter approach emerges: the strategic use of Terraform modules. These modular building blocks allow teams to sculpt their infrastructure desires independently. QA teams can summon specific resources, the Dev team can beckon different services, and the production environment can luxuriate in its unique set of resources. It's a symphony of flexibility, enabling each environment to dance to its own AWS tune while maintaining order and efficiency.
Terraform modules diagram is divided into two main sections: production and development. Each section contains a set of modules that are specific to that environment.
The production section contains modules for our core infrastructure, such as our network, load balancers, IAM roles, and NAT gateways. The development section contains modules for our development and testing infrastructure, such as our development VPCs and subnets.
